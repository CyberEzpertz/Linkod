# Linkod

**Linkod** is a Next.js application that aims to make local government services ‚Äî specifically at the *Barangay* level ‚Äî more accessible and convenient for everyone.  

The platform is two-pronged:
- **Mobile/Web App** ‚Äì For people who are tech-savvy and prefer the convenience of a smartphone or computer.  
- **Kiosk Software** ‚Äì For citizens who may not own a smartphone, are less tech-savvy, or simply prefer in-person assistance at their Barangay hall.  

Both versions provide the same streamlined services, ensuring accessibility and inclusivity for all citizens.
